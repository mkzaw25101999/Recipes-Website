        <h3>About Me</h2>
        <h2>Hi there! My name is Tommyüëã</h2>
        <p>
          And I am a university student studying in Finland. I live in Tampere
          with two of my friends. I cook our meals every day, and I‚Äôve found it
          to be a casual hobby while studying.So, I started a blog on Instagram and created this website
          <strong>(·Ä°·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÄ·Ä∫)</strong> on my own as a way to share my love for
          food and creativity with the world. <br> What began as a small hobby has grown
          into something truly meaningful
          to me‚Äîa place where I connect with others through simple, delicious
          meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always loved experimenting in the kitchen, whether it's baking
          fresh bread or trying new global flavours. But more than anything, I
          enjoy seeing people come together around food.
          This blog is where I pour that passion into recipes, stories, and
          ideas that I hope will inspire you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being here. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a
          long-time reader, I'm so glad you stopped by.

  <h2>Why I Love Food</h2>
  <div class="story-card">
  <p>
    I love food because I grew up watching my mom cook with so much care and love. She always knew how to make something special out of simple ingredients, and her food made everyone happy.
    Our kitchen was always full of good smells, laughter, and people enjoying her meals. That inspired me to start cooking too ‚Äî not just to eat, but to create something that brings people together.
    Every time I cook, I remember how she made it feel so natural and joyful. That‚Äôs where my love for food truly began.
    When I moved to Finland for university, cooking became my comfort. I started preparing meals for me and my friends, and I noticed how food could turn a normal day into something special.
    It made me feel connected ‚Äî not just to home, but also to the people around me. Sharing meals helped me build friendships and feel less alone in a new place.
    I began to see cooking as a way to express myself. Trying new recipes, mixing flavors, and creating dishes from different cultures made every day more exciting.
    That‚Äôs what led me to start this blog ‚Äî a place where I can share the food I love, the stories behind it, and hopefully inspire others the same way my mom inspired me.
